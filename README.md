# So what is this?

Do you want to listen something while playing this awesome game, but you just don't want to turn off music and play your own? Or you just want to know what this mod do, than...
It's mod that replaces **every single track** in CrossCode!!!
Not even every single, we went even further and added several new tracks to bosses and events!!!
Why do we did this? *Just for fun lol*.
Come on, give it a try, you're not gonna regret it.
